# Kickstarter-Analysis
An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
- The purpose of this analysis was to determine the outcome of the campaigns changed with respect to the date in which they were launched, and with respect to the size of their funding goal.


## Analysis and Challenges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- One of the challenges I kept encountering was accurately calculating the total count of outcomes based on the amount of the funding goal. I kept getting results from my formula that weren't matching the correct results. After playing with the formula, I had realized that I was using the values in the "Pledged" column instead of the values from the "Goal" column. That error was substantial enough for me to easily see that something was wrong with my formula based on the values I was getting. 

## Results
What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- That for every month, more campaigns successed reaching their goal than those that failed or canceled their fundraiser. 
- That there was a drastic increase in campaigns that were launched in May, almost doubling the monthly average. 

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- It can be concluded from the "Outcomes based on Goals" graph that the larger the goal a campaign needs, the higher chance it has at failing; while the smaller the goal is, the higher the chance it has to succeed.

What are some limitations of this dataset?
- One limitation of this dataset is that it only gives data from 2009 to 2017. This restricts the data to only data recorded during these nine years. 
- Another limitation is that this dataset represents data from 21 countries. This restricts the data to only data from these 21 countries and can't be used to accuratley reflect the entire world.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- Another table I would like to see is how many backers did the successful campaigns have compared to the campaigns that failed. 
- Along with that, I'd also like to see the average donation each backer made to see if the reason a campaign failed had been influenced by the backers not paying as much as those backers who supported the successful campaigns. 
- Another table of interest would be the success rate per parent category, to compare the success rate varies depending on the parent category and see which types of campaigns are the most successful in reaching their goal.
